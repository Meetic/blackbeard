*When working in a quite large team or, in a quite large project, have you ever experienced difficulties to test multiple features at the same time?*

Usually, teams have 2 alternatives :

* Stack "features to test" in a queue and wait for the staging environment to be available;
* Try more or less successfully to create and maintain an "on demand" staging environment system, where each environment is dedicated to test a specified feature.

Blackbeard helps you to create ephemeral environments where you can test a set of features before pushing in production.

It also provide a very simple workflow, making things easier if you plan to run automated end-to-end testing.
